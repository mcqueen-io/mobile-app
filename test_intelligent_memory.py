Test script for Queen's Intelligent Memory Formation

This script demonstrates how Queen can extract and store important life events
from natural conversations, including:
- Job interviews
- Appointments  
- Birthdays
- Trips
- Presentations
- Emotional context

Run this to see Queen's intelligent memory extraction in action.
